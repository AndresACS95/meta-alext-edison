Description:
============

This Yocto layer is a collection of various fixes and feature additions
for Intel Edison board's Linux image (based on Yocto).

**Layer maintainer:** Alex T <alext.mkrs@gmail.com>

This layer depends on the layers from the Edison BSP + meta-openembedded.
See README files in recipe directories for any additional dependencies and other
specific instructions.

This is work-in-progress, so e.g. kernel-related recipes won't work as-is and so on,
so take the commit messages into account before using those or other recipes.

Feel free to ask questions through GitHub's bugtracker for the repo or
in Intel Edison Community at https://communities.intel.com/community/makers/edison/forums
